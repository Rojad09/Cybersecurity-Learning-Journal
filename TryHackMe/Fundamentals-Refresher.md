# Cyber Security 101 - Refresher Notes
**Start Date:** 2025-11-30
**Status:** In Progress
#### TryHackMe provides a course titled "Cyber Security 101", which seems to be an assortment of teachings related to Cyber Security as a whole. Although it seems to be showcasing the very basics of Cyber, as a way to refresh my knowledge, gauge my readiness, and most importantly, learn how to document my projects, I decided to begin with this course. The concepts that I decide to make notes on may vary depending on my whim, as it seems to be knowledge that I am familiar with, but as a refresher and practice, I hope to note most concepts, no matter how basic.
